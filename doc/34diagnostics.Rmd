## Model Diagnostics

### Convergence
The maximum likelihood parameter estimates found by \gls{admb} indicated a well-converged model. The base model had a small maximum gradient component (0.000102) and a positive definite Hessian matrix, both of which are associated with converged models.

Runs with 100 alternative sets of starting parameter values found no models with a better likelihood (Table \ref{tab:jittertab}). Of the 100 jittered model runs, 23 re-converged to the best estimates associated with the base model, while 62 converged to a likelihood value ~6% higher than that of the best estimate. No jittered model runs achieved a better likelihood than the base model. The proclivity of the model to converge to a nearby local minimum implies either a complex likelihood surface or very a flat likelihood around the minimum. Regardless, we are confident that the base model achieves the best possible fits to the model data.

### Sensitivity Analyses
#### Sensitivity to growth parameters
Growth parameters are uncertain for `r spp` due to difficulties in determining age from otoliths and subsequent lack of length-at-age information for this species, thus, sensitivities of length-at-age 25% higher and 10% lower was conducted to encompass the uncertainty in growth within and between data sets. Different assumptions about growth did not have much influence on relative spawning depletion. Depletion levels in the final year were slightly greater in a higher growth scenario and slightly lower in a lower growth scenario (Figure \ref{fig:growth_sensitiv_mngmt}). Spawning output was more sensitive to assumptions about growth, with much higher spawning output when assuming a higher growth scenario (Figure \ref{fig:growth_sensitiv_spawning}). The high growth sensitivity had a slightly better overall fit to the data, including to the survey indices and length compositions (Table \ref{tab:sentivititytab}). Different assumptions about growth influence recruitment patterns and the timing of strong year classes. However, the influence of different growth assumptions is also sensitive to changes in other parameters, such as natural mortality.

#### Sensitivity to maturity
The 2023 assessment used updated maturity-at-length information from the \gls{s-wcgbt} and port-sampling (Melissa Head,\gls{nwfsc}, pers. comms.), which showed a larger length at 50% maturity ($L_{50\%} = 31.4$ cm) and slower rate of maturation (slope = -0.177) in the logistic curve compared to the smaller $L_{50\%}$ (18.1 cm) and faster rate of maturation (slope = -2.304) assumed in the 2013 assessment based on @pearson_gunderson_2003. A sensitivity was conducted to maturity information from the two datasets and to an intermediate maturity-at-length logistic curve (mix_curve, $L_{50\%} = 24.8$ cm and slope = -0.350). As in the 2013 assessment, estimates of population scale and status in the base model were not sensitive to different maturity assumptions (Figure \ref{fig:mat_sensitiv_spawning}; Figure \ref{fig:mat_sensitiv_mngmt}). Differences in fits to the data were negligible. The slightly higher stock status in the final year with the @pearson_gunderson_2003 maturity assumptions is likely due to females from strong cohorts in the 2000s assumed to mature at younger ages compared to the base model. As stated in the 2013 assessment, the slow growth rate of `r spp`, with growth still occurring at age 100, reduces the importance of assumptions about maturity because older individuals will have significantly higher spawning output due to their much larger size, regardless of the fraction spawning. 

#### Sensitivity to Landings
Two sensitivities were conducted to explore how changes in the historical landings timeseries effect modern-day estimates of stock status. One sensitivity replaces the historical landings reconstructions prior to 1962 with the imputed landings that were used in the 2005 and 2013 assessments. A second sensitivity replaces all landings information prior to 2013 with the values that were used in the 2013 assessment. There was little appreciable difference to base model fits across the two sensitivities (Figure \ref{fig:land_sensitiv_spawning}; Figure \ref{fig:land_sensitiv_mngmt}). This is likely due to the fact that historical catches (pre-1962), and changes in catches due to state-level catch reconstruction updates, were relatively small and thus would have had minimal impact of the biomass timeseries. 

#### Sensitivity to Abundance Index Methods
The 2023 assessment uses model-based indices (MBIs) of abundance derived from geostatistical models, which differs from previously used design-based approaches (DBIs). There remains limited agreement on how best to approach model selection for such models. Therefore, two sensitivity analyses were conducted on the methods used to estimate indices of abundance: 1) using MBIs derived from a geostatistical model that assumed a lognormal error structure (compared to a gamma error structure in the base model); and 2) using newly calculated DBIs.

Estimates of population scale and status were not sensitive to changes in error structure used in the MBIs or changes in estimation methods (i.e. use of design-based indices). Small reductions in estimated spawning output were observed when lognormal error structures were used in MBIs as well as when design-based indices were used. No appreciable improvements to model fit were observed between model-based indices that used gamma or lognormal error structures. The use of DBIs reduced model fit compared to the base model (Figure \ref{fig:surv_sensitiv_spawning}-\ref{fig:surv_sensitiv_mngmt}).



### Retrospective Analysis
Retrospective analysis indicates that removing the most recent years of data has minimal impact on the estimates of spawning output (Figure \ref{fig:retros_spawnbio}) and stock status (Figure \ref{fig:retros_bratio_uncertainty}). This is consistent with the results of the likelihood profile over $R_0$ (Figure \ref{fig:R0_prof})) which showed that the data are moderately informative about stock scale. While the analysis does display some very minimal evidence of a retrospective pattern, all estimates of spawning output in the retrospective analysis fell within the 95% uncertainty interval around the base model spawning output time series (Figure \ref{fig:retros_bratio_uncertainty}).

As in the previous assessment, there is little evidence that such retrospective patterns are the result of additional years of survey abundance data (Figure \ref{fig:retros_indices}), and thus, it is most likely that removal of informative length composition data is the source of such pattern.

### Likelihood Profiles
Likelihood profiles were conducted over the log of unfished recruitment ($R_0$), the steepness of the stock recruit relationship ($h$), the value of natural mortality ($M$), and the growth curve. 

A likelihood profile over $\ln(R_0)$ was performed to assess the influence of the various data sources on the unfished scale of the population. The profile shows most of the data sources to be in agreement regarding the best estimate of $R_0$, with the exception of the indices of abundance, which are best fit by larger values of $R_0$ (Figure \ref{fig:R0_prof}). Similarly, there is little inconsistency in likelihood contribution by fleet across the range of plausible $R_0$ values (Figure \ref{fig:R0_prof}), though the Triennial survey does appear to be the source of the disagreement. This indicates that the data, together, are relatively informative about the overall scale of the population. The highest spawning output and lowest depletion levels were associated with higher $R_0$ values (Figure \ref{fig:R0_spawnout}).

Likelihood values and model results were largely insensitive to changes in steepness (Figure \ref{fig:h_piner_prof}). The change in negative log likelihood over the range of $h = 0.5–1.0$ was less than 10 units with the largest contribution coming from recruitment and abundance indices. No other likelihood component had a change of greater than 1 unit. The lowest $B_0$ and depletion values were associated with the most productive population, with $h = 1.0$, but there was no qualitative difference between any of these cases (total change in depletion values across the range of $h$ tested was ~0.02 units; Figure \ref{fig:h_spawnout}). The apparent lack of influence of h on population dynamics for `r spp` is likely the result of the relatively high estimated stock status across the entire time series, which makes estimation of h difficult. 

A likelihood profile over natural mortality ($M$) found the model results to be quite sensitive to the assumed value of $M$: with all values of $M$ 0.025-0.055 resulting in likelihoods within 7 units of the base model (Figure \ref{fig:M_prof}). Meanwhile there was no support in the data for values of $M$ above 0.06 or below 0.02. The profile over $M$ does not indicate the existence of a "best" value over the range of values tested, which fully encompass the values seen in the literature. Length composition data, particularly from the south trawl fleet, was the major contributor to the changes in likelihood observed over the range of tested values for $M$ (Figure \ref{fig:M_prof}). All plausible values of $M$ resulted in similar levels of depletion (Figure \ref{fig:M_relspawnout}), but a wide range of levels for unfished spawning output (Figure \ref{fig:M_spawnout})

### Unresolved Problems and Major Uncertainties
Few problems remain totally unresolved, though improvements to the model fit to the \gls{s-wcgbt} abundance indices and to the North Trawl fleet length compositions would be desirable. In addition, being able to freely estimate the width of the selectivity plateaus for many of the fleets and surveys would also improve the model. 

The model fails, at this time, to fully capture the observed increase in abundance seen in the \gls{s-wcgbt} index time series, significantly underestimating the abundance in 2021 and 2022 (Figure \ref{fig:fitscombo}). Better fits to \gls{s-wcgbt} length compositions in those years could possibly improve fits to the indices, but improvements to the length composition fits proved difficult without introducing time-blocked selectivity. As the \gls{s-wcgbt} is supposed to follow highly standardized survey methodologies, there seems to be minimal justification for introducing time-varying selectivity in the model at this time. The model also fails to fully capture the peak of the length compositions for the Northern Trawl fleet, underestimating the number of mid-sized fish that the fleet takes (Figure \ref{fig:lencomps_all}). This underestimation appears to be consistent, particularly in the last 10 years (Figure \ref{fig:ntrawl_comps_2}), implying a possible recent change in selectivity. While time-varying selectivity was not investigated here, if this trend persists, future assessments may wish to apply a selectivity time block to this fleet in order to better capture the peaks of the length compositions.

Major uncertainties in the model are centered around uncertainty in the biological parameters that govern growth, maturity, and natural mortality. Due to a lack of reliable aging methods, growth was estimated externally to data collected in the 1990s (see Section 2.3.4 for more information). Sensitivities conducted on length-at-age demonstrated that changes to the assumed growth function could have large effects on the estimated stock status (Figure \ref{fig:growth_sensitiv_mngmt}). Due to inconsistent histological data, which suggest spatial variation in maturity-at-length for `r spp`, there remains some uncertainty about the shape of the species’ maturity curve, though the model appears to be largely insensitive to variation in maturity (Figure \ref{fig:mat_sensitiv_mngmt}). Finally, likelihood profiles over natural mortality demonstrate the model to be quite sensitive to its assumed value. There is insufficient information in the data to estimate natural mortality directly, constraining us to using meta-analyses or other natural mortality estimators, which frequently make use of aging information that is largely unavailable and highly uncertain for `r spp`.
